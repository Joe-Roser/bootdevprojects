Following the boot.dev tutorial on go. Trying to learn the basics.
Am a bit worried that I'll be too functional pilled to be able to like go but oh well.

Post project:
I have learnt a lot about go from this. Given its the first time I've touched the language, I think it's pretty cool. The web services and Json decoding are very easy to use and get the job done quick.
Would definitely benifit from a result type ngl, but im not too functional to need it. Would also love let as variable assignment, just cause.

Would like to add: Better caching, Better repl ui, more commands, saved state.
