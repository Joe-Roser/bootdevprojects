# A place to put all my boot.dev projects.

So far I have done most of the pokedexcli project. I have found it useful for learning go. Kinda happy not to be using rust ngl. Its a much simpler proccess. Hate gopls tho. Wish it had better code actions and would update when packages are updated in real time.
